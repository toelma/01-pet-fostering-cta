      <h3>Why Foster a Pet?</h3>
      <p>
        Fostering a pet helps save lives by providing a safe and loving environment until they find a permanent home. It’s a rewarding experience that makes a real difference for animals in need.
      </p>
      <p>
        You’ll give pets a second chance and enjoy the companionship of a grateful friend. Join our community of foster families and help us create more happy endings!

    <h3>Don't be Afraid of a Foster Fail</h3>
    <p>
      Sometimes, foster families fall in love and decide to adopt their foster pet. That’s called a “foster fail”—but it’s really a happy ending! Whether you adopt or help a pet move on to a forever home, fostering is always a win for animals in need.
